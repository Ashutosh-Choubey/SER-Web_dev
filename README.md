# SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION
Speech is by far the best-known way to understand the actual meaning of what the other person is saying. Texts and emoticons at a place can convey wrong emotions or meaning to the conversation, whereas speech as a response can convey better meaning and emotions to the conversation. With the continuous boom in technologies in recent years, Speech Emotion Recognition can be of a great help reducing the extra man-power deployed at any place. Technological advancements like MFCC which work very similar to the human ear can actually increase the efficiency of traditional systems. When this feature extraction technique is combined with powerful Neural Networks, can actually give eye-catching results, and maybe served as an alternative to the human ear in many cases. 
   
The speech emotion recognition model can help in so many areas like Education Industry, HR department, Call Centres, Emotion Quotient detection etc. 
The basic needs for such model is there should be a system which shows huge data into simplified manner as needed, take out some meaning out of random scrap data, removes redundant manpower, should integrate well with the ongoing work procedures, should increase the efficiency of the whole process and last but not the least, should be economically viable.
